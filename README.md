If you somehow mannage to make more than $5000 from this project, we would like a 5% cut of those profits, please.



Todo:
Scripting:
* Add development-tool: image to level converter.
* Overhaul Gravitron-script: Choose from 8 directions, automatically assign graphics from direction, only one gravitron may act upon the player at the time.
* Script for Gravitrons assigning animation in the right direction
* An animation-script allowing one to choose time between frames
* Have a look at that boost-script; 'Qulu was right: There is no reason for it to need a surface to push off of
* Make the portal-script a more smooth transition
* A minimap

Audio:
* When you die
* When you reach a chekcpoint
* When you pick up a divine bit
* Something for the background

Levels: We'll see what works best
* One like a linear obstacle-course
* One open-ended with very small rooms
* One open-ended with huge open spaces
* One open-ended with each room an obstacle-course
 
Textures
* Still need those gravitrons!
* A proper earth-block (Make it in grayscale to allow recolouring in the editor, please)
* A background that looks better
