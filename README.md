Todo:
Scripting:
* Animations for player movement
* Bits that the player must collect
* Portal that opens when bits are collected
* Additional bits that might provide some story but no ingame effect
* A message that opens and displays the content of the bit which was picked up

Audio:
* When you die
* When you reach a chekcpoint
* When you pick up a divine bit
* Something for the background

Levels: We'll see what works best
* One like a linear obstacle-course
* One open-ended with very small rooms
* One open-ended with huge open spaces
* One open-ended with each room an obstacle-course
 
Textures
* Try and see what happens if we go from 64x blocks to 32x blocks.
